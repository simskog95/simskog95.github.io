    <h2>Can I complete basic military training (conscription) even if I have a visual impairment?</h2>
    <p>A visual impairment is not a general obstacle to being enrolled. Different positions have different requirements for your vision. The lowest requirement for visual acuity is at least 0.1 in a single eye without lenses or glasses. With glasses or lenses, visual acuity must be at least 0.8 in the best eye and 0.1 in the worst eye. Visual acuity in both eyes together must be at least 0.5 with glasses or lenses.</p>

    <h2>Can I do basic training if I am diagnosed with ADHD or ADD?</h2>
    <p>Individuals with a neuropsychiatric disorder (NPF) diagnosis or other diagnoses can apply for assessment and receive an individual evaluation. According to the National Service Act, the most suitable individuals must be selected for the Armed Forces' combat units. To support this, there are, among other things, the Armed Forces' medical assessment criteria, which determine what types of medical impairments are reasonable to have based on the demands of war. If you have mild ADHD and are assessed as not needing medication, you will no longer be automatically disqualified prior to the enlistment process. All other forms, however, are disqualifying, as the National Service Act requires that those best suited are selected to meet the demands of war.</p>

    <h2>Can I be enrolled in basic training even if I have been convicted of a crime?</h2>
    <p>No, if you have been convicted of a crime, you will not pass the security clearance.</p>

    <h2>Can I be enrolled even if I have a disease or an allergy?</h2>
    <p>Certain diseases, diagnoses, and injuries can be reasons for not being accepted into basic training. When you answer the enlistment questionnaire, you will, among other things, answer questions about your health and physical condition. If you move forward in the process, you will undergo a medical examination during the enlistment.</p>

    <h2>What roles within the Armed Forces can I apply for after conscription?</h2>
    <p>If you have completed basic training with passing grades, you have the opportunity to apply directly to the Home Guard, officer training programs, or vacant jobs as a squad leader, soldier, or sailor.</p>
